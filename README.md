# Portfolio

For this assignment we were tasked to construct a portfolio showing our work and ways to contact us. 

I started with the html building a header, nav links, and cards to fit within the page. From there I did some work gathering my images from my own body of 
work to a few reference images from Google. I then decided what links I wanted to attach to my page, from the work I've done in this course (which unfortunately
is not much, yet!) but also some links to my LinkedIn profile, my instagram, and I even attempted to generate an email link which seems to work sparingly. 

Once I added in all these elements I worked on constructing my layout and fitting everything with a layout designed for mobile devices and tablets. 

# Updates!

As of 11/6 I've made some changes to the files! From adding new images to updating links to show my Resum√© new images and reorganizing the flow of the cards on the page. Take a look at what was changed below! I've also added in my [GitHub](https://github.com/joecliffordofficial) page and also my updated [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-clifford/). I wish I had more time between class and work, but we make do with what time we have. 

With that said, please take a look and what I've cooked up so far!
